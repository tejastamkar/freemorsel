    des: "Thousands of nonprofits and individuals across the country work diligently to raise funds and collect supplies in the fight against hunger. When disaster strikes, the need for these resources is often amplified, yet organizations struggle to match the demand and meet the needs of their communities. Specifically, that’s what we’ve seen as a result of Covid-19 outbreak. With schools closed, millions out of work, and a looming recession ahead, families are finding that they don’t know where their next meal will come from. To make matters worse, most food banks and pantries are being depleted of their resources faster than they can replenish them.",

    des: "It is that time of the year where winter is a curse on northern India's underprivileged people. Survival is difficult for the poor, but winter creates additional burden on them. It is a desperate struggle for the homeless and poor to survive the winter season. This winter, charity blankets donations will help us to provide warm clothes to homeless. We at Ratna Nadhi are encouraging individuals to donate woollen clothes. These donated warm clothes and blankets will be further distributed to homeless and underprivileged people in our society. We all have got warm/woollen clothes which we don't wear anymore or they don't fit us anymore. You know you are hoarding all these clothes which are no use now. “Give away” these warm/woollen clothes to the poor and be the reason for someone's unmatched joy.",

    name: "Educate a child",
    des: "Access to education has always been a challenge for under-privileged children. However, due to the pandemic, as livelihoods were affected and many families were further pushed into poverty, children from lower-income groups suffered the most. Only about 28% children living in rural areas and slums had access to digital learning. Education came to a halt for lakhs of children, who had already been struggling in the pre-pandemic world. Smile Foundation, through its 'Shiksha Na Ruke' initiative, has been helping children from difficult circumstances get back to school and restart their lives with hope. At present, we are directly providing education to over 100,000 children in 23 states of India. Despite all the odds, these young champions have not given up and continue to dream and work hard. With your support, we can fuel their dreams with accessible and quality education. Join hands with us to ensure a happy and safe childhood for all!",
